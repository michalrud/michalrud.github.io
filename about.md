Started programming in QBasic in primary school, then moved to Delphi.

Interested in many programming languages, probably that's why he doesn't know any of them perfectly.

Professionally uses C++, had a brief embedded node.js adventure. Thinks languages are just tools that lets a good programmer to achieve his or her goals. Fascinated by [bf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), as it is the simplest language he knows. Writes small tools in Bash, Python, Ruby or JS - usually depending on which language has nicer libraries that would help solving the problem. Still tries to figure out whether he prefers Go or Rust. It takes him longer than it should to get through [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), but he doesn't give up.

Loves riding his bike.
